Client & Server
----------------

Ways to access files on a remote server
1. RDP - Remote Desktop Protocol(for Windows)
2. FTP - File transfer protocol
3. SFTP - Secure FTP

Pre-requisites:
1. Authorization 
2. Knowledge of above techniques

In order to bypass above things, we can use the HTTP protocol and enable access to the files through the means of a web/HTTP server - for eg Apache server. 

Difference between application server & web server
--------------------------------------------------

App server enables clients to execute .class files and access the result, whereas a web server grants access to static HTML files rendered by browsers. Another difference is the executable files need a container (Java EE) for executing them on the remote web server.
